global_costmap:

### COORDINATE FRAME AND TRANSFORM DATA PARAMETERS

   # The global frame for the costmap to operate in.
   global_frame: map

   # The name of the frame for the base link of the robot.
   robot_base_frame: robot_footprint

### RATE PARAMETERS

   # The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
   # Set to 20.0 (the same rate at which the controller is called in base_local_planner)
   # First run value = 20.0
   # The call rate is slowed to try and get rid of the control loop update error.
   update_frequency: 10.0

   # The frequency in Hz for the map to publish display information
   # Set to 20.0 (the same rate at which the controller is called in base_local_planner)
   # First run value = 20.0
   # The call rate is slowed to try and get rid of the control loop update error.
   publish_frequency: 10.0

### MAP MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS

   # The width of the map in meters.
   width: 40.0
 
   # The height of the map in meters.
   height: 40.0

   # The resolution of the map in meters/cell.
   # Second run value = 0.05
   # The resolution is halved to try and get rid of the control loop update error that is perhaps being caused by a too high resolution slowing down the processing rate.
   resolution: 0.025

   # The global map remains static while the local map changes as the robot moves and senses.
   static_map: true

   # If the map is static the rolling window parameter must be set to false.
   rolling_window: false
